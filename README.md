# **Game Concept:**



*   A mixed 2D and 3D exploration and puzzle RPG 
*   Follows a young child that’s home alone; who begins chasing after a figure that they suddenly see, in an effort to escape their growing feeling of loneliness. 
*   The child’s journey would involve them going through the halls and rooms of the house, and maneuvering through obstacles set by the figure and (mentally) by themselves, in order to continue moving on 
    *   The player will face obstacles they will have to problem solve, that will trick the mind into wondering what is real or not (2 types of obstacles)
        *   (Fictional Obstacles)_ The bed turning into a monster, the shadows of a lamp trying to attack the player, hanging pictures changing, boxes in the attic exploding_
        *   (Realistic Obstacles) _Pushing a desk out of the way, trying to get over a stack of fallen objects, etc._
    *   The player will be able to explore in each level (room), and progress once they can successfully leave the room 
        *   _(doors will unlock once all obstacles are defeated)_
*   **Themes:** are **_loneliness, mental health (v. imagination), and self-discovery/awareness_**, and works to show that being alone doesn’t mean you’re lonely. 


### **What Sets This Game Apart:**



*   Has a horror game aesthetic but doesn’t have major horror aspects/ elements:
    *   No possible death scenarios, no jump scares
*   Heavy emphasis on mental health and isolation - anxiety, loneliness, paranoia 
*   Discusses topics of proper childhood development - conquering one’s imagination
*   Combines and emphasizes the way a child may see the world, with how an adult sees it 
*   Height differential play - (pov of a child moving through the world)

# MDA - _Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics_


### **Mechanics:**



*   Physics System, Collison System, Movement System, 3D Puzzle Platformer
*   Jumping; Walking; Grabbing, Collecting, Moving, and Picking Up Objects


### **Dynamics:**

Problem Solving



*   The player will face puzzles that will encourage them to think quick, and use available resources to their advantage. The player will use the mechanics to interact with objects in the level to help them advance; but it’s going to take problem solving to know which controls to use, when to use them, and how they can work with what’s around them. 

Navigation 



*   The Player will have to learn the mechanics to navigate through the level. They will have to explore the environment of each level to discover key elements that can help them progress in the game; obstacles in the level that they need to be cautious of; and collectables that can support them in the discovery aspect of the game


### **Aesthetics:**

Anxiety



*   Elements like the panic meter, in conjunction with the sound effects and UI features of this aspect, will force the user to feel in a state of anxiety as they are trying to solve the puzzles presented in front of them, without maxing out their panic level

Connection to the Narrative



*   The intention of the game is to immerse the player into the perspective of a child, and this is achieved through height differential point of view, the presence of imaginary obstacles, and lack of emotional control of the character in the game
*   We are also hoping to immerse the player into the setting and themes of the game through our use of music, color scheme, architecture, and overall vibe of the game 

Discovery



*   The Player will be given opportunities in every level to find collectables that will help in the discovery aspect of the game, and will also give relief and comfort to the player

Challenge



*   Our game won’t provide much obvious directions, and will require the player to play close attention to their surrounding, previous knowledge of mechanics, and the possibility of learning new mechanics and tricks to help in figuring out how to solve obstacles

Curiosity



*   Tapping into the challenge aspect of the aesthetics the player will be full of curiosity, from figuring out how to leave/solve a level, how to catch up to the mysterious figure, what is the figure’s true identity, and what do all the collectables mean.

# **Narrative (Brief):**

Gabriel, a 7 year old child, awakes from a nightmare in his shared bedroom, in a panicked state. The child looks around for his sister in the room, in order to receive comfort, but no one is in sight. The child begins walking anxiously down the halls, calling for his parents and sister; but no one responds. Falling deeper and deeper into a state of fear and anxiety the child begins to lose hope believing that he is completely alone. Until he hears the loud squeaking of the attic floorboards; which piques his interest to further investigate if someone is home with him. The child makes his way up to the attic using the built in ladder, but the room appears to be empty. Now fully in the attic, the child cautiously makes his way around stored and forgotten junk, peeking around corners and listening for someone. As the child makes his way closer and closer to the opposite wall of the attic, he sees a slight change in lighting from the window; as if something was walking around outside the house. The child makes his way to the window; and as he slowly rises on his tippy toes to get a clear vision of the outside world, he spots a shadowed person standing ominously still, near the front of the house. The child continues to rise on his toes, and once he could see completely out of the window, the figure instantly looks up at the child and rushes into the home through the front door. The child gasps loudly, as his mouth drops, and his mind fills with mixed emotions of fear and curiosity of who this figure is. The child quickly lowers off his tippy toes and spins around to begin making his way downstairs to find this figure. However, as the child completes his 180 turn from the window, he spots the figure standing at the end of the room, just barely in front of the ladder entrance. The child pauses, taking a moment to stare at the figure and determine his feelings in this moment. The child begins to lift his foot off the ground, to take a small step towards the figure, and just as his rose foot begins to inch back down towards the creaking floorboards, the figure jumps down the ladder entrance; causing the ladder to aggressively slam close; shaking objects in the attic to the floor and blocking the child’s exit path in the room.

# **Game Play:**

The player will be playing as Gabriel, maneuvering through obstacles in order to catch up to the figure; to discover the figure’s true identity and to cure his growing feelings of loneliness. There will be two types of obstacles: One where the obstacles are created by the figure, which will involve household items standing in the way of the player progression (realistic). And the other being where obstacles are created by the child’s imagination, and they seem extremely real to the child but aren’t actually real (fictional). Both present no real threat, but the fictional obstacles will encourage the player to problem solve in order to stay safe; while the realistic obstacles will encourage problem solving as a means to progress in the game. All obstacles will be able to be overcomed using objects found in each room/level; and smaller scaled puzzles can be presented beforehand to demonstrate the mechanics, and/or visual and auditory cues can be used to assist the player in coming up with solutions. As the player solves the puzzles, the fictional obstacles (2D assets) will disappear from the room, signifying the child’s anxiety easing away.The player will have an anxiety meter, and if they can’t solve the fictional obstacles in a timely order, it will continue to rise. If the anxiety meter gets maxed out, the player will have a panic attack and pass out; forced to restart the level.


# Worldly State Of The Game:

This game is taking place in real time; and the game’s world can only truly be described as: being the real world, through the lens of a child with a vivid imagination. With vivid imagination, the world that the child creates becomes their only world; and outside factors have no direct impact on this. (_[Visual Example: Inside Out, “Floor is Lava”](https://youtu.be/87vu-vozuss?t=108)_) Imagination vs mental health is a key theme that is supposed to present in this game; looking into that boardline of when a child’s vivid imagination is used as a way to help them understand the world and when it’s used as a method to cope with mental health problems (in this circumstance, anxiety). Projections of this world are supposed to represent what it’s like inside the mind of the child, whose imagination is running rapid; where we can only understand, what the child understands while in their situation - in a setting where everything isn’t as it seems. The child has a fear of being alone; so with that in mind, taking the emotional distress that comes as a result of his overwhelming fear, mixed with the intense level of imagination that children are capable of, he has created this world where the only thing that’s present is his fear. Thus forcing the situation, this game, where the child has to come face to face with his fear of being alone. His vivid imagination explains why his family isn’t anywhere to be found, why the texturing of the 3D Assets (realistic items) are cartoony; why the player can see and interact with 2D Assets (imaginary items); and why he is trying to find comfort in the only other “person” in this world (who is a figure that randomly appears, and was created as a way of coping with his fear and anxiety). Below explains these gameplay aspects, and how they relate to the narrative, and research on children with vivid imaginations. 


# Gameplay Elements:

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Child’s Physical Limitations:</span> Why There’s Complexity In Solving/Maneuvering Obstacles



*   The child’s strength and height has some disadvantages
    *   This will add complexity and encourage problem solving within the game.
    *   Some obstacles that may be easier for an adult to solve, will be harder for a child to solve - which will encourage the player to get creative with their surroundings to make it through the house
    *   Ex: the child might need to climb up drawers to make it to the top of a counter to avoid going through a ditch full of scorpions in the kitchen
    *   Ex: the child might need to push objects in the attic ontop of the attic’s exit because it won’t open with only the child’s weight and strength

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Child’s Mental Health:</span> Why There Are Fictional and Horror-esque Obstacles



*   (Studies shown) If a child has high _anxiety_ levels it can lead to a vivid imagination 
    *   This will lead to self created threats and problems - this the creation of the figure and the outrageous (2D asset) obstacles that wouldn’t commonly be found within a home.
        *   As task are completed, these 2D assets obstacles can begin to disappear - signifying growth and “curing of anxious feelings”
    *   The world to the child will become a world that fits within the current emotional state and mindset that the child has
        *   As a coping mechanism to help them face their anxieties and/or as a fear-induced setting because the child can’t control his overwhelming feelings and imagination
*   Anxiety levels will be showing through the screen slowly turning black (via vignette) and can be tracked via the panic meter 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Child’s Innocence:</span> The Drive To Chase After The Figure



*   The intense feelings of _loneliness_ leads to the creation of an “imaginary” companion to help with the dealing process 
    *   The child’s innocence of being friendly and curious bypasses the taught behaviorals of being scared of the unknown
        *   Leading to the child’s craving for interaction with the figure, and the drive to meet with it, because not being lonely is their #1 priority
